I have tried to integrate langchain , gemini and SQL in this project. This is a simple POC project. 

The main objectives are :

1. Learn to use Langchain and Google gemini integration 
2. Learn to integrate SQL and both of these together 
3. Use vector search to get relavant prompts and then send it to LLM to generate SQL query.
